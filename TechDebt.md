- Goal use HashMap`Cell`s instead of the grid
    - `height` should be initialised with the parameter
    - `width` should be initialised with the parameter
    - `grid` should be initialised with nested for loop with all the `Cell`s positions
        - `currentGeneration` should return a list of `Cell`s
        - `addLivingCell` should use `Cell` to tell the cell to become alive
        - `nextGeneration` should use the hash map of `Cell`s
        - `isAlive` should use the hash map of `Cell`s to check whether cell is alive or not
