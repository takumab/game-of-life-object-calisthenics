- Goal use HashMap`Cell`s instead of the grid
    - [X] `height` should be initialised with the parameter
    - [X] `width` should be initialised with the parameter
      - [X]`grid` should be initialised with nested for loop with all the `Cell`s positions
        - [] `currentGeneration` should return a list of `Cell`s
            - [X] Create a map between `currentGenerationNew` and `currentGeneration`
        - [] `addLivingCell` should use `Cell` to tell the cell to become alive
          - [X] `findCellAt` should be used to locate the cell for `addLivingCell` 
        - [] `nextGeneration` should use the hash map of `Cell`s to change the state of the grid
        - [] `isAlive` should use the hash map of `Cell`s to check whether cell is alive or not
          - [] `isAlive` should pass coordinates to a `Cell` method that finds the cell at the coordinates provided
            - [] `findCellAt` should use the coordinates to return the correct `Cell`
